      A large enough ride invariably mixes all types of personalities and the party atmosphere 
      must come with a sense of knowing the difference between carefree and reckless. 
      If someone's riding or behavior feels uncomfortable, we find it's generally best to say something
      to the person. <strong class="dark:text-white">If someone tells you they're having
      an issue with your behavior, err on the side of respecting their experience.</strong>
