      Critical Mass is a mass bicycle ride that takes place on the last Friday of each month in cities around the world.
      Everyone is invited! No one is in charge! Bring your bike! Bring skateboards, rollerblades, e-scooters, e-bikes.

      <h1 class="text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">Disclaimer</h1>
      Denver Critical Mass is meant to be a safe and welcoming space for everyone, 
      regardless of gender, race, ability, body types, sexual orientation, or socio-economics. 
      We value and celebrate the diversity that is Critical Mass.
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 pt-0">
      Please understand that your ride stewards are doing their best. Riders
      who come to Denver CM are overwhelmingly friendly, courteous, and safe.
      We're here for a good time, spreading happy Friday joy.

    <div class="p-4 pt-0">
      Any large ride includes different personalities and experience levels. The
      party atmosphere doesn't invite recklessness. If someone's riding or
      behavior feels uncomfortable, say something to them.
      <strong class="dark:text-white">If someone tells you they're having an issue with your behavior,
      err on the side of respecting their experience.</strong>

      <h1 class="text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">Thoughts</h1>
      We get an overwhelmingly fun response from people we pass. Many drivers
      honk with support. Many wait patiently for our bus to roll through. But
      how we are perceived is not guaranteed to be positive. We are demonstrating
      one night a month, for a couple of hours, in small chunks of the city.
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 pt-0">
      Our ride may appear incongruent with some people's beliefs about how to use
      streets. Even among ourselves, we have different values that make sense only
      because cars pervade everything about daily life.
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 pt-0">
      Think of this ride as a grassroots bike bus that makes itself safe by
      sheer numbers. We are challenging some norms.
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 pt-0">
      We want streets that are safe for all people, all the time. That happens
      by lessening our use of personal car trips, including Uber and driverless
      taxis.
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 pt-0">
      Most days, people bike, walk, scoot, and take transit as individuals. That
      should be easy, safe, reliable, and dignified. When streets are safe for
      people, maybe a big demonstration won't be necessary. Maybe streets designed
      for people will invite more social and cultural richness.
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 pt-0">
      Respect others, respect yourself, and respect the mission of Denver
      Critical Mass: <strong class="dark:text-white">to celebrate every person's
      right to dignified use of our streets with everyday options besides a car,
      and to provide safety in vibes and numbers during our events</strong>.
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 pt-0">
      This is your ride as much as it is everyone else’s, and we’re all counting on
      each other to keep it going.
